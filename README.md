# Algorithm Benchmark For Windows
Benchmark for Windows PCs that shows how fast computers can sort lists and rates how good your system is at it. Heavily impacted by processor and RAM speeds.
The score is based on my hardware in 2020:

- CPU: i7 4790
- RAM: 4x8GB DDR3 1600MHz C10

I achieve a score of 900-1000 on each run. More cores do not provide a higher score but clock speed does.
